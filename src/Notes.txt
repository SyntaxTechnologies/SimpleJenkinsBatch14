CI/CD:
    Continues integration and continue development.
    All the software that we use weather it's a website or app or any operating system.
    They are in a continue state of change. we need to continuously develop and update
    these software so that the customer can use the latest features. Jenkins is one such
    software that will help us automate this process.
1)  Once the software is ready and looks good on the developers machine. Developer
    pushes that code to the development server. He verifies the changes and runs a few
    test cases to make sure all works fine.
2) Once all looks good QA will request to deploy the changes on QA server. We also need
   to take approvals from team leads or managers.
3) Once all looks good on QA take approval from head of team write an email again to
   deploy all the changes to staging server.
4) Once all look good on staging do the same for the production.
